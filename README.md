# SolvePoverty
Solving poverty is a **huge global challenge**, but you *can absolutely contribute* using technology — especially **C#, ASP.NET, and .NET**.

Let’s turn **“solve poverty”** into **a real, actionable software project** that can make real-world impact.
I’ll give you:

1. **A realistic problem statement**
2. **A powerful ASP.NET project idea**
3. **Architecture + features**
4. **Why it actually helps fight poverty**

# 🌍 **Poverty Problem (Simplified for a Project)**

Most poverty is driven by:

* Lack of **job opportunities**
* Lack of **access to skills training**
* Lack of **financial inclusion**
* Lack of **support networks**
* Lack of **local resource visibility**

So let’s build a system that actually helps people access what they need.

---

# 🚀 **BIG Project (but simple to start): "Community Support & Opportunity Platform"**

This is a **full ASP.NET Core platform** that connects:
✔ people who need help
✔ organizations offering support
✔ local job opportunities
✔ micro-learning resources
✔ donors & volunteers

This is the type of platform NGOs and governments would love to use.

---

# 🧩 **Core Idea (simple version)**

A web platform where **people in need can request help**, and **others can offer help**, jobs, services, food, or donations.

---

# 🏗️ **ASP.NET Project Overview**

## ⭐ **1. Users**

* People in need
* Volunteers
* NGOs / charities
* Job posters (local businesses)

## ⭐ **2. Features (simple version)**

* Create an account
* Create a “help request” (food, clothes, money, training, job, service)
* Post offers (jobs, donations, services)
* Match requests with offers
* Messaging system

---

# 🌐 **3. Features (big-tech level features)**

You can grow the project into a serious system:

### ✔ **Smart Matching Engine**

Match people to resources automatically:

* People asking for food → nearby food banks
* People seeking jobs → local job postings
* People needing education → free courses
* Volunteers → urgent requests

Powered by C# services + EF Core + maybe ML.NET.

---

### ✔ **Micro-Learning Platform (Mini Coursera)**

Short skill lessons (cooking, farming, coding, CV creation).
Helps people gain employable skills.

---

### ✔ **Donation + Crowdfunding System**

Donors can support specific people or causes.
Use Stripe / PayPal integration.

---

### ✔ **Local Map of Free Resources**

(food banks, shelters, charity offices)

Use Google Maps API + ASP.NET.

---

### ✔ **Real-time Chat (SignalR)**

People needing help ➝ Chat with volunteers.

---

### ✔ **Analytics Dashboard**

Admins can see:

* Most common requests
* Which areas need support
* Donation patterns
* Job demand

This part mirrors systems used by NGOs and social services.

---

# 🏛️ **ASP.NET Core Architecture (Clean Architecture)**

```
/Solution
  /Api                (ASP.NET Core Web API)
  /Application        (Business logic)
  /Domain             (Entities + Interfaces)
  /Infrastructure     (EF Core, Email, Auth, Storage)
  /WebUI              (Blazor or MVC)
```

---

# 🗂️ **Database Tables**

* Users
* HelpRequests
* HelpOffers
* Jobs
* Donations
* Courses
* Messages
* Organizations
* Events
* Skills

SQL Server + EF Core.

---

# 🎯 **Why this actually helps fight poverty**

This platform does **three powerful things**:

### 1. **Connects people to immediate help**

Food, clothes, shelter, emergency donations.

### 2. **Creates opportunities**

Jobs + skill training help people escape poverty permanently.

### 3. **Empowers communities**

Volunteers and donors can support real people transparently.
